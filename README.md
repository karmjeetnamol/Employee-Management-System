# Employee-Management-System


#  Descriptions

Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. Often these interfaces are known as Content Management Systems. In this mission, I architected and built a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.


# Installations
I created the Employee Management System with npm packages: MySQL, Node, Inquirer, and console.table design pattern.
